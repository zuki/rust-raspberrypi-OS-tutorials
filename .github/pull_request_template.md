### Pre-commit steps

 - [ ] Tested on QEMU and real HW Rasperry Pi.
     - Not needed if it is just a README change or similar.
 - [ ] Ran `./contributor_setup.sh` followed by `./devtool ready_for_publish`
     - You'll need `Ruby` with `Bundler` and `NPM` installed locally.
     - If no Rust-related files were changed, `./devtool ready_for_publish_no_rust` can be used instead (faster).
     - This step is optional, but much appreciated if done.
